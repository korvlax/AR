### How do I get set up? ###
* Configuration
To compile the program ar.cpp you will first have to create a folder called for example "build", enter this folder and run the command "Cmake ..". This will create executables from
the source file. After this run the command "make". Now everything should be compiled. To run our executable just run the command "./ar". If you have a working webcam, the program should
start to capture images from it.
* Dependencies
You will need OpenCV, c++ compiler, cmake and make.
